# Source Data Preparation to upload in the Archive and ERDDAP Server

Each variable can be managed in the following ways by reading directly from downloaded folders:

.[Step1](https://github.com/007-Ozalp/CMEMS-Reanalysis-Data-Management/blob/main/step_1_CMEMS_REANALYSIS_AdriaticSea.ipynb) corrisponds to time:30/31 days and depth level: 74 over Adriatic Sea.

.[Step2](https://github.com/007-Ozalp/CMEMS-Reanalysis-Data-Management/blob/main/step_2_CMEMS_REANALYSIS_AdriaticSea.ipynb) corrisponds to time: 365/366 days and depth level: 74  over Adriatic Sea.

Prepared datasets within associated metadata have to be in CF convention to be uploaded in the ERDDAP Server.
