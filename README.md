. Source Data Preparation to upload in the Archive and ERDDAP Server is in the [this folder](https://github.com/007-Ozalp/CMEMS-Reanalysis-Data-Management/tree/main/Folder%20Management%20for%20the%20CMEMS%20Datasets) in [step 1](https://github.com/007-Ozalp/CMEMS-Reanalysis-Data-Management/blob/main/Folder%20Management%20for%20the%20CMEMS%20Datasets/step_1_CMEMS_REANALYSIS_AdriaticSea.ipynb) and [step 2](https://github.com/007-Ozalp/CMEMS-Reanalysis-Data-Management/blob/main/Folder%20Management%20for%20the%20CMEMS%20Datasets/step_2_CMEMS_REANALYSIS_AdriaticSea.ipynb).

. Prepared Ocean datasets within associated metadata have to be in [CF convention](https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/) to be uploaded in the [ERDDAP Server](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html).
